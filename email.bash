You are selected to be the speaker (for paper) for the simulation lunch meeting to be held 2 weeks later (25/August/16). But one of the paper presenter for next week (18/Aug/16) needs a swap, do you mind of presenting a paper next week instead of 25/08/16? (http://smutch.github.io/simslunch_site/index.html) 

It will be totally fine if next week is not good for you :)

Cheers,
Yuxiang'
